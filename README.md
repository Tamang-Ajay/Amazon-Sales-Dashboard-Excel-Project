## 📌Overview:
I’m excited to share a dynamic and interactive Sales Dashboard I built in Microsoft Excel as part of my self-learning journey in data analysis.
This dashboard was created to analyze Amazon sales data (2024) with the goal of helping businesses and analysts track performance and make data-driven decisions more effectively.

## 🎯Goal and 🚧Challenges:
The goal of this project was to analyze and present Amazon sales data to:
1)Understand total revenue and units sold
2)Visualize city-wise and state-wise sales performance
3)Break down sales by product categories
4)Provide quick, interactive access to insights via hyperlinks

Challenges I tackled:
- Cleaning and organizing raw sales data for consistency
- Structuring data to support pivot-based analysis
- Creating region-wise and product-wise breakdowns with accurate visualizations
- Adding navigation features to improve dashboard interactivity

## 🛠Tools Used:
- Excel (Data Cleaning & Formatting, Pivot Tables and Charts, Slicers & hyperlinked navigation, KPI Metrics, funnel and map visualization)

## 🔧What I Did:
- Cleaned and prepared raw sales data for analysis
- Built multiple pivot tables to summarize key metrics
- Created line charts, funnel charts, and map visuals
- Developed hyperlinked navigation for a seamless dashboard experience
- Visualized performance across different cities, states, and product categories

## 💡Impact:
- Gained practical experience building a dashboard from scratch
- Strengthened my skills in Excel, data visualization, and data storytelling
- Simulated how e-commerce businesses track sales KPIs and regional performance
- Created a user-friendly report that supports data-driven decisions

This self-initiated project helped me build confidence and apply my skills in a practical, business-focused way.
